<h2 id="course-overview">Course overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to Natural Language Processing and the Human Record! This
course is the seminar-level offering from the Digital Humanities (DH)
minor. A predominant theme in the course will be the study and analysis
of <em>under-resourced</em> languages: languages, histroical or
contemporary, which have limited technological support, like grammars,
parsers and machine-translation. As natural language processing (NLP)
becomes more and more critical scholarship, these languages tend to be
crowded out by well-resourced counterparts like English, French and
Mandarin Chinese. In this course, we will look at new ways of addressing
these problems.</p>
<p>To begin, we will refresh your understanding of dependency parsing
and Python skills by exploring the advanced features of the software
package <code>spaCy</code>. We will then turn to webscraping techniques,
including data collection, curation and storage, to build a corpus of
several non-English languages. Starting in week 8, we are going to start
training out own neural nets and deploying these models to help us
understand and interpret texts in under-resoursed languages. By week 11,
we will explore advanced model training with machine translation,
transformer-based architectures. This material will help us as we study
and utilize cutting-edge tools like large language models (LLMs),
artificial intelligence (AI) and retrieval augmented generated
(RAG).</p>
<p>Students will be responsible for a final project which is meant to
apply any of the technqiues that we studied to an under-resourced
language of their choice.</p>
<p><strong>Textbooks and readings:</strong> There is no textbook for
this course. Instead, most class material will be posted on our <a
href="https://canvas.tufts.edu">Canvas</a> page when appropriate. As NLP
and DH are very interdisciplinary fields, we will also be reading
several articles, from a variety of fields, which will help us think
through different perspectives and technical reasonings.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as
ChatGPT:</strong> If you use AI tools to assist you in any part of the
assignments or final project of the course, you must document it. Either
in a separate note or included in the assignment write-up, tell me what
tool you used and how you used it. You are not expected to use these
tools for the course and students can succeed without use of these
tools. I would encourage students to forgo use of these tools until week
11 and the case study section of the course at which point explaination
of confusing code or model architecture could be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Conduct:</strong> Tufts holds its students strictly
accountable for adherence to academic integrity. The consequences for
violations can be severe. It is critical that you understand the
requirements of ethical behavior and academic work as described in
Tufts’ Academic Integrity handbook. If you ever have a question about
the expectations concerning a particular assignment or project in this
course, be sure to ask me for clarification. Each student is responsible
for upholding the highest standards of academic integrity, as specified
in the <a
href="http://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy">Tufts
University policies</a>. It is the responsibility of each student to
understand and comply with these standards, as violations will be
sanctioned by penalties ranging from failure on an assignment and the
course to dismissal from the school.</p>
<p><strong>Grading and Course expectations:</strong> * Assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 30% * Class participation: 20% <em>Nota Bene: Class
participation consists of class attendance, office hours and engagement
with course material. It is meant to give credit for your interest and
enthuiasm with the course material. It is expected that all students
will view the required videos, read the required articles, cases,
chapters and other materials, and participate in online discussion
forums. I reserve the right to adjust a grade if these requirements are
not fulfilled.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grading range:</strong> A passing grade in the course is B-
or better. Course grades will be based on the below ranges (subject to
revision during the course):</p>

<p><strong>Submission of Graded Material</strong>: Assignment due dates
will be specified on Canvas. Assignments received after their deadline
will be penalized ten points per day unless extension is approved in
advance. Students who are unable to complete an assignment or exam on
time for any reason should notify the instructor by email prior to the
deadline, with a brief explanation for why the extension is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation of Disabilities</strong>: Tufts University is
committed to providing equal access and support to all students through
the provision of reasonable accommodations so that each student may
access their curricula and achieve their personal and academic
potential. If you have a disability that requires reasonable
accommodations please visit:
https://students.tufts.edu/student-accessibility-services/how-we-help/academic-accommodations
to make arrangements for determination of appropriate accommodations.
Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively,
making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity Statement:</strong> We believe that the diversity
of student experiences and perspectives is essential to the deepening of
knowledge in this course. We consider it part of our responsibility as
instructors to address the learning needs of all of the students in this
course. We will present materials that are respectful of diversity:
race, color, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, religious beliefs,
political preference, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic
status, citizenship, language, or national origin among other personal
characteristics.</p>
