        "In the past two notebooks in this webscraiping series, we saw how we could use Python to automate getting data from websites. First `beautifulsoup` gave us a method of navigating the HTML of a static webpage and then `selenium` allowed us to parse dynamically generated pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll look at a specialized source of data that we can pull from, Reddit. Reddit.com is a collection of forums where uses can discuss topics of shared interest. A lot of people use Reddit, so many NLP researchers use it as a place to gather data for novel datasets. In this example, we'll collect a swathe of text from [r/latin](reddit.com/r/latin) and save it as a CSV.\n",
        "\n",
        "Over hte past few years, Reddit has made it very difficult to get large chunks of their data. That said, another group, pullpush.io, have saved and hosted terabytes of histroical Reddit data for public use. We'll be using their API in this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Nota Bene**: pullpush's API service is designed for academic use only! It is an incredible resource, especially because it is free. Please do not abuse it!"

Most fluent readers (and speakers) of Latin seem to like and recommend it. Though if you don't find the pure Latin instruction to be quite to your liking, it can be supplemented. Focus has a companion book with additional instruction and grammar in English, which I've been using a little. That one however has more mixed reviews and there are definitely other resources that can supplement LLPSI, and people will probably give you recommendations on that front elsewhere in this thread.\\n\\nEdit: I can't be certain, but I'm guessing Wheelock's isn't a great supplement, compared to materials written specifically to go along with LLPSI.

You must study inscriptions independently and you cannot rely on your general Latin as we have seen so far in the thread.\\n\\nFor Ops it is meant the goddess by the same name, not the regular word ops opis. She is similar to magna mater and is often identified with her. It is good to understand the fluidity to Roman religion before Christianity, gods and goddesses always have varying names and identities. \\n\\nThe reading is probably all in dative which is typical for inscriptions on buildings, especially thresholds, with the verb absent, “[this building is] for Divine Ops, [who is also] the Great Mother”',\n",

              "    'body': 'Haven’t read the book and some of these words aren’t whole (e.g. “DIV” and “MAT”), however it seems to have something to do with Magna Mater and her divinity and power. Here’s a breakdown of the words:\\n\\n“Div” is likely from “divina, divinae” meaning “divine.” Often used in describing a figure’s divinity.\\n“Ops” is probably from “ops, opis” meaning “strength” or “power.”\\n“Magna” is from “magna, magnae” meaning “greatness” or “largeness.”\\n“Mat” is from “mater, matris,” given the context, meaning “mother.”\\n\\nThe sentence seems to be saying something about how divine and strong the great mother is. Without the endings, it’s hard to tell exactly what the sentence says, because the root word gives the vocabulary, but the endings tell us the grammar of the word and how exactly it should be used in the sentence. The ancient writing could have said any of these things, for example:\\n\\n“Divinae ops magna mater” (the powerful great mother of divinity)\\n\\n“Divina opsque magna mater” (the powerful and divine great mother)\\n\\n“Divina et ops est magna mater” (divine and powerful is the great mother)\\n\\n“Divinae ops est magna mater” (powerful is the great mother of divinity)\\n\\nThe possibilities exceed what’s on this list, however, I think out of these, number 3 makes the most sense because it’s just a general statement of praise/veneration. Marking this in a cellar to indicate dark or forbidden activities having taken place there in the name of that deity is a neat thing to do. I’d take it as kind of a sign of only those in this seemingly forbidden brotherhood were allowed in that place; it’s quite a spooky setting.\\n\\nAdditionally, I feel like knowing those words and being able to form an idea of what they’re saying but not having a full translation also adds to the terror as vagueness and ambiguity can be horrifying, and that’s kind of what Lovecraft is all about, from what I hear. I suppose it’s the idea of “something terrible happened here, but exactly what, we’ll never know.” Knowing what the worshippers are talking about but not ever knowing what exactly they’re saying or what acts they’ve committed in that place is pretty thrilling!

              "    'body': 'The author of this was horrible at Latin. He not only made an obvious mistake, but he also did code-mixing with German to fill in a hole in his Latin knowledge. I am taking some liberties with this, but here is my guess:\\n\\n“Were married as a public act of penance due to a behind closed doors transgression”\\n\\nIn the context of the German, “transgressio septi” seems to be a euphemism for extramarital coitus. The mistake in declining “transgressio “ following “ob” seems consistent with someone with poor Latin knowledge inserting a phrase that they consider special. This is a mistake that I would expect from an English speaker rather than a German speaker, but my knowledge of German is almost non-existent, so I am at the limit of my ability to make sense of why the mistake was made beyond doubling back to saying that the author was bad at Latin.\\n\\nI decided to treat “transgressio” as if it had been properly declined as “transgressionem”. I decided to interpret “septi” as “behind closed doors” because it refers to something enclosed and seems to be some sort of idiom that does not make sense in a literal translation. My decision here was to reinterpret it in a way that fit the context.\\n\\nI translated “pro” as “as”. This does not seem like a common translation, but it was the possibility that made the most sense. In particular, a priest will often say at the end of confession “for your penance ...”. I interpreted “pro” to have that kind of meaning, such that “as” and “for” are interchangeable and I could take the one that sounds more natural.\\n\\nI translated “ob” as “due to”. I inserted articles that were absent due to Latin not having them and rearranged the phrases to fit English’s word order. I am relying on on others for the translation of the German to “were married”. It was the last piece needed to make this make sense.\\n\\nIn the original text, the transgression is emphasized by being placed first. Translating it into English required moving the verb to the front, but doing just that neither seemed to flow well in English nor seemed to convey the original meaning, so I swapped the phrases for the sake of making the translation sound more natural.\\n\\nThat said, it sounds like they had extramarital coitus, were caught and were forced to marry. The woman might have been pregnant.',\n",

The noun \"latīnus\" means \"a Latin man\" and \"graeca\" means \"a Greek woman\". One cannot use these nouns to refer to languages any more than one can say \"Englishman\" to mean \"the language of the Englishmen\".',\n",

I am sorry that you were offended by the statement that my teacher doesn\\'t teach--it clearly resonates with you deeply and your rant is most likely reflective of some inner tensions. However, that statement is unfortunately shockingly accurate and is supported by nearly every student in the classroom. Our classroom activities consist of the class struggling through a translation without any support or guidance from the teacher (on the contrary students are sarcastically ridiculed), and then being tested on concepts outside the few materials we are given. Any attempts to seek help from the teacher generally result in being guilt tripped or attacked passive aggressively. While I recognize the validity of your argument that saying \"my teacher doesn\\'t teach\" helps no one, your assumptions about me based off of that statement are completely unfounded. On the contrary, it is clear that by coming onto reddit asking for help, I am taking initiative and responsibility for my own learning. I am not merely saying I don\\'t understand, but am providing specific conceptual weaknesses that I would like to address. Finally, I go to a highly competitive public school where teachers usually get tenure after 2 years, and are VERY well paid relative to the national average, so I doubt that they take a teaching job just because they love teaching (it might be the only job available for someone with a obscure degree in the humanities)--if that was the case, maybe my teacher wouldn\\'t be so unpleasant to deal with (they do have personal issues but they shouldn\\'t prevent the teacher from doing their job). Regardless, I appreciate the time you took to provide me with some life advice. I am grateful for it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlue',\n",

              "    'body': '&gt;my teacher doesn´t teach\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a helpful framing to address your challenges because...\\n\\n1. It\\'s almost certain that your teacher *does* teach. If they have tenure at at school in the US, they have bare minimum standards they must meet. If they\\'re at a school without a tenure system or haven\\'t earned tenure yet, they are subject to even more scrutiny.\\n2. It places the burden for your learning on the teacher, not where it should be - *on you*. There\\'s no debate about this issue in the research. If students want to learn, *they* have to do the intellectual heavy-lifting. Teaching is a process that supports them in those efforts, not the primary vehicle for accomplishing them.\\n3. It obscures the conversation that you *should* be having with your teacher right now. If this is how you actually feel, you **need** to communicate it to them in a productive way, e.g. \"I appreciate the efforts you\\'re putting in to help us understand this material, but I still find myself confused and not quite following what you\\'re doing when you \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_. In the past, I found that when you did \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_, it was clear and more helpful to me. Could we incorporate more learning activities like that into this class? If not, could you suggest some resources or habits for me to use on my own to help?\"\\n\\nTeachers don\\'t keep teaching if they *don\\'t* want their students to succeed. It\\'s *way* too much work, time, energy, and - frankly - bullshit to deal with for way too little compensation. They are invested in your success, but attaining that means you need to communicate with them about what is/isn\\'t working for you and why. The first step to doing that successfully is adopting a mindset and language that doesn\\'t (1) minimize what others are doing to try and help, even if it\\'s not working *for you* (it may be working very well for others!); (2) accurately recognizes the collaborative nature of learning and your role in it; and (3) works to build bridges and solve problems.\\n\\nThat last part is especially important. Teachers hear \"I don\\'t understand\" dozens of times every.single.day. That statement in itself is ***not*** helpful, since it doesn\\'t offer any clue about *what* you\\'re not understanding, *how* you\\'re thinking about the information, or *any* frame of reference about things that *have* worked to help find a more successful approach. Sorry for the avuncular tone, but after a decade of hearing students say this in one form or another, I\\'m past just nodding and have moved on to intervening, since \"my teacher doesn\\'t teach\" as a critique helps literally ***no one*** \\\\- not you, not your classmates, not your teacher, and not even random strangers on the internet like me.',\n",

I don\\'t know what your current experience is, but someone with no prior experience working intensively with LLPSI can get to reading the vulgate within perhaps three months. Your required time will be even less if you already have some exposure to the language. \\n\\nLLPSI works in line with how Second Language Acquisition works; it is entirely in Latin and gradually works its way up from the simplest of sentences (Roma in Italia est) to adapted passages from Latin literature (including passages from the Vulgate). If someone is learning English, for example, we wouldn\\'t simply teach them the grammar and give them Shakespeare; we would slowly ramp up the difficulty and give them a large *quantity* of input that they can understand. It does take a large *quantity* of level-appropriate reading to internalize a language and LLPSI is to my knowledge the only text designed specifically for this purpose. So LLPSI will build you to the level of reading the Vulgata and fits your purpose quite nicely.\\n\\nYou could of course simply open up the Vulgate, get an English translation, a grammar book, and a dictionary, and grind through each sentence slowly word-by-word; but this is slow and laborious, and besides, doesn\\'t get you to a place where you are understanding the Vulgate natively in Latin. If your goal is to *read* the Vulgate, and not merely *decode* it, you do need a lot of practice reading easier texts with gradually increasing difficulty. If you progress at a rate of one chapter per day you will be through LLPSI in a little over a month and ready to begin reading the gospels.\\n\\nedit: To be clear, what I have recommended here will specifically help you to read the Vulgate. If you do not have time for an intensive pace it will take longer, but still, LLPSI will be the quickest path there. If you are interested in reading Christian philosophical and theological texts these can be quite difficult and will require much more time which the second Lingua Latina book will help with (but for the Vulgate it is not strictly necessary, though it might help). These texts might also require some knowledge of important Roman philosophers/writers, especially Cicero, Seneca, Vergil, and Ovid who tend to get cited a lot, and are more difficult than the Vulgate.',\n",

The normal active participle form was used. So *moriens* would be a correct nominative participle.\\n\\nStill, if I'm not mistaken, Latin originally used a separate ending *-bundus* to create present participles of deponent verbs. A few of those survived in classical Latin, such as *vagabundus* from *vagari*, and *moribundus* from *mori*. But they were no longer treated as the participles of those verbs, just as adjectives derived from those verbs.\\n\\nSimilarly confusing, by the way, the gerundive of a deponent verb actually has passive meaning.\",\n",

However saying \"lingua Latina\" is correct too. \"Sermo\" is a masculine name of the third declension (maybe that \"-o\" made you think it was an ablative or you thought it was a neuter substantive) and the subjet of this sentence so the adjective \"Latinus\" must be also masculine and nomative. \"Iucundus est\" is a nominal predicate so \"iucundus\" must be nominative and masculine too. \"Est\" is the action of the subject which is singular, not me and you, but another so we have to choose the third person of present indicative of \"sum\" which means \"I am\" (the verbs in Latin vocabulary are not written in their infinitive form as it happens in the modern languages), and it\\'s at the end of the phrase because if you read old Latin authors you realize that verbs are always at the end of the sentence, except in rare cases, but that is not wrong. Latin isn\\'t like English: having conjugations the subject can be removed and having the declensions the position of the words is more free because the cases define their role in the phrase. In English subject can\\'t be removed because all the verbs have the same ending and we would not understand who made the action and also you must respect their position in the sentence if you want to be understood.',\n",

The LLPSI series will help with that; there are also readers made in the late 19th/early 20th century which are designed with the same goal in mind (Ad Alpes is one, but there are plenty, in varying quality).\\n\\nAs for advanced authors, some are harder than others and a lot will depend on your own background. If you know a lot of Hellinstic philosophy, Cicero and Seneca\\'s philosophical works will come more easily; maybe you don\\'t have a good background in Roman history and politics and so Cicero\\'s speeches might come harder. Conversely perhaps you are well versed in Medieval or Renaissance periods and those texts may be easier for you; they tend to be a bit simpler Latin-wise, though sometimes can have some oddities here and there. Above all, the more you read of an author the easier their work gets. In my mind, Cicero\\'s philosophy and Livy\\'s history marks as good a starting point as any because they both have very clear styles; Caesar is often recommended as a first author because his extremely compact style is easier to translate, but from a perspective of *reading*, in my opinion he is more difficult than relatively clear authors; besides, Cicero\\'s style became the thing-to-imitate and so exposure to that will make it easier to read the authors he influences.\\n\\nedit: I somehow forgot, but Nepos is perhaps the easiest Classical author; very accessible and quite good too!',\n",

Then, for something more obscure, I enjoy _Dē verbōrum significātiōne_, Paul the Deacon’s epitome of Sextus Pompeius Festus’ epitome of Verrius Flaccus’ great lexicographic work, where you’ll find some quite unique ‘stories about words’, discussion about archaic Latin, obscure _hapax legomena_ and quotations from old forgotten authors. Definitely of more marginal interest but I think that if you’re learning Latin you’re the kind of person who’d savour that.\\n\\nNow, on to the Classical period, Catullus is easy, enjoyable and, since he’s so widely taught, has a lot of resources (on Perseus Tufts you can find a completely literal English translation—I wish there was something like this for more texts). Then, Ovid is approachable as well but definitely more difficult already, and, I think this is an unpopular opinion, Juvenal is actually an okay author for intermediate readers: he is very fun to read too—the difficulty lies not in grammar, but in his cryptic way of expressing himself and his nigh-incoherence, difficulties  which a Loeb parallel text edition should alleviate.\\n\\n(By the way, use loebclassics.com for a rich catalogue of Latin—and Greek—texts with parallel translations (reasonably literal), a limited critical apparatus and helpful annotations and introductions.

There might be another library somewhere that does something like that, but I can't think of one offhand.\\n\\nI'm looking at the library's page for Vat. Lat. 10696. The page mentions that it's from Livy, that it's sec (sic!) IV-V, and also includes a rather large bibliography. But as far as I can see, it doesn't mention that this fragment of Livy is XXXIV, 36-39. Now, probably most people who went to Vatican website looking for Vat. Lat. 10696 would already know that it's XXXIV, 36-39. Still, it wouldn't have taken up all that much room on the page to mention it. The information might have been helpful if some beginner had just stumbled across this while browsing the library's website.\",\n",

              "    'body': \"Yes, this is exactly what I thought. I would absolutely recommend the LLPSI books then; you will be able to go quite quickly at least through the beginning, and by the end of the first book you should have internalized most of the grammar. For the later chapters, you will also benefit from rereading them. I would also suggest that you try to avoid thinking in terms of translation, and try reading and understanding the text as Latin, without translating it into English! The LLPSI books will greatly help with this. There is audio for the book on the channel ScorpioMartianus. You may also want to watch his pronunciation videos, because most people have poor pronunciation, especially with regards to nasalization, vowel length, and elision, which, if properly understood and internalized, will aid greatly your understanding of the Language, particularly with poetry. \\n\\nAnd you might be surprised to know that people *do* write in Latin every day! There is a discord for this sub (see the sidebar) where people use Latin, there are also weekly Latin chats via Zoom, and a host of Latin podcasts of varying difficulty. The podcasts are particularly helpful, in my view, because they help you internalize the grammar but are at the level of simple, day-to-day conversation rather than high literary Latin--because, remember, Latin literature would've been difficult for native Latin speakers in the same way English literature is difficult for native English speakers! Writing in Latin is also an excellent way to internalize structures; you can write a short response to whatever you read in Latin that day, and if you get stuck, you can look up how a word is declined/conjugated on Wiktionary, or you can use the sentences from what you read as a scaffold.\\n\\nThe problem about not knowing how to word things is really unfortunate because that's not really your fault--translation is a difficult skill and many people know a language quite well but struggle to translate. Many Latin instructors just put a premium on translation, but really it's an art, not a science. Obviously, you need to understand the Latin, and be able to render it in English. The first part should become easier with the advice I listed above. If you feel your skills still aren't up to par after you've spent a lot of time with level-appropriate input, you might consider reading more English poetry--because at its heart, translation is a creative task, and having a more technical understanding of English creative writing will give you greater command to make your own translations.\",\n",

My guess (though I don\\'t know your circumstance) is your class has the same problem. The research suggests that when we are learning a second language, we need vast quantity of level appropriate input material (which can include reading, listening, etc); but the standard methods give students a small quantity of *too difficult* material. This is probably a big reason why you find Russian easier, because you\\'ve gotten more input material. The single best thing you can do is find intermediate material and read that as extensively as you can; it will help you internalize the language. The best resource if you have not used it is the book series Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata; the first part of the book may be too easy, but the second half will be your speed and besides, reading the whole thing will help you process Latin as Latin.

All three are attested already in the Classical period (only the latter one hasn't made it into the literary language, but is already found at Pompeii). See Weiss 2009 (Outline..) p 528.\\n2. the fact that V is lost in almost all verbal endings in almost all of Romance is not evidence to its ordering after the development of said endings because even if there had been a single set of proto-Romance endings (which again there wasn't), V was already optionally lost intervocalically in pre-Classical Latin (resulting in doublets like *dīvitēs\\\\~dītēs* as well as the already mentioned *l(a)ātrīna*), and continued to vacillate throught the history of the language. The B\\\\~V intervocalic merger simply fed more instances of the same process, until the V-less variant was generalised in all the verbal endings, as in the imperfect ē/ībat &gt; ē/īvat &gt; é/íat.\\n3. To my knowledge, there's absolutely no indication to any difference in the pronunciation of /V/ between *sermō vulgāris* and any other *sermō*. There's only indications to regional variation (c.f.

How many times have you said \"ay\" and not \"uh\" for the word \"a\" in the above paragraphs even though that\\'s \"proper\"? In the first sentence your reading voice probably read the first sentence as \"...uh vee or jay\" but the fourth sentence \"wee doo ay similerr thing...\" (I\\'m intentionally spelling to pronunciation in these examples). You also probably didn\\'t say \"sim-ih-laar\", you said \"SIM-ih-ler\". You do this and they likely did the same with ius (ee-yoose) as yoose as they spoke conversantly with other Latins. By contracting the sound like this, they developped these letters with a consonantal and verbal form.',\n",

              "    'body': '[Follow-up]\\n\\nThere are multiple reasons that we know \"v\" was pronounced as /w/. Contractions are one of the biggest - we see the intervocalic (between vowels) \"v\" being elided and skipped over entirely. A *lātrīna*, or bath (whence English \"latrine\"), is really a *lavātrīna*, from the verb *lavāre* (to wash), i.e. a \"place for washing.\" We see the same kind of contraction with *mōmentum* from *movimentum* and many, many others. We also see contractions where \"v\" becomes \"u\", as in *faustus*, which is contracted from *favestus*. We also occasionally see remnants of this in modern Romance words. For example, *cīvitātem* yields French *cité* and Italian *città*, both of which feature the same elision of the original v, which is absent in the modern words. However, in Spanish, it is the second \"i\" of *cīvitātem* that is lost. The modern Spanish word is *ciudad*. \\n\\nPronouncing \"v\" as /v/ really breaks all observable patterns, since determining when to pronounce it as /v/ versus /u/ or /w/ is entirely arbitrary. The verbs *statuere* and *volvere* have past participles *statūtus* and *volūtus* respectively, but, in the ecclesiastical pronunciation, *stat**u**ere* has /u/, and *vol**v**ere* has /v/. It breaks an obvious pattern for no reason other than alignment with modern pronunciation. Another example is the verb *caveō,* with past participle *cautus,* which, if \"v\" is presumed to be pronounced /v/, has /v/ in the infinitive, but /u/ in the participle. The reverse is true of *gaudeō,* with past participle *gāvīsus*. \\n\\nIt also makes far more sense for \"v\" to be pronounced /w/ when considering cognates. \"Vir\" (man) is derived as being a cognate to English \"were-\" as in \"werewolf\" (man-wolf). English and other Germanic languages additionally borrowed many words from Latin many centuries ago. \"Wall\" and \"wine\" come from \"vallum\" and \"vīnum,\" respectively. We can also see evidence in cognates from languages from Latin\\'s time. The Ancient Greek word for wine was *οἶνος* (oînos), which sounds far closer to *vīnum* when pronounced with /w/. We also see Ancient Greek *ναῦς* (nâus) cognate to Latin *nāvis*, among others.',\n",

              "    'body': 'In Classical Latin, V was pronounced /w/. This is undisputed by linguists. However, we do know that in the *sermo vulgaris*, the common speech, V began to transition into the sound /β/. If you\\'re unfamiliar with the IPA, this sound is like a \"v\" in English, except, instead of using your top teeth and bottom lip, you use both lips as if to make a \"b\" sound, but push air between them as you would for a \"v\" sound. Since then, the vast majority or Romance languages have since progressed to from /β/ to our modern /v/, with some exceptions (most notably Spanish, which still pronounces \"v\" as /β/ today) \\n\\nThis sound change really isn\\'t that unexpected - for one, we observe the same change in other languages, such as Ancient Greek. For example, in modern Greek, the word τραύμα (trauma) is still written with the vowel letter \"υ\" but will be pronounced by any modern speaker as \"travma.\" /w/ and /β/ are closely related sounds - the only real difference between them is that, from /w/ to /β/, the lips go from being almost, but not fully, closed to having full closure. \\n\\nWe think that this shift began around a century before the first century CE. We know this because of attested typos in which letters and such mistakenly write \"b\" where \"v\" would be correct. However, we also know that it happened after the developments of Proto-Romance verb endings, meaning that Vulgar Latin was already diverging heavily from Classical Latin by the time the sound change had become widespread.',\n",

Look at what the pronoun itself is doing *in the relative clause*. Cf. English -- The students whom the teacher loves are the best. Even though \"students\" is the subject, the pronoun is still in the objective case because the pronoun is the direct object of the clause \"whom the teacher loves.\" In the clause, the teacher loves the students -- students is the object of the clause. Thus, the pronoun (which stands in for the students in the clause) is the direct object of \"loves.\" In a Latin sentence, you would therefore use the accusative case.',\n",

Here are some options in no particular order.\\n\\n* Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles: https://geoffreysteadman.com/ritchies-fabulae-faciles/\\n* Re-read Familia Romana (or just your favourite chapters, I like Cap. X. for example)\\n* Read the storylines from mainstream textbooks (Reading Latin, Cambridge Latin Course, Oxford Latin Course, the stories that go with Wheelocks, etc.) I personally really like the story in Oxford and the Cambridge ones are free online at the moment.\\n* Read the easier stories in Fabulae Syrae and Fabulae Latinae (in the LLPSI series)\\n* Read some novellas such as Pugio Bruti (Here is a list: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bF8hZuxTDtgNMSSdonEX112JJaVYqoPH7w27Oju9ETs) If you've read Familia Romana then I'd focus on the ones that have 100+ unique words; you'll read them easily and learn a bunch of new words. *Cloelia* has a free PDF.\\n* Take a look at some of the material in Sermones Romani if it interests you.\\n* These are some Vergil/Caesar tiered readers: https://lapis.practomime.com/index.php/operation-caesar-reading-list There are other similar things you can buy as books (I like this one: https://comprehensibleclassics.wordpress.com/publications/). This Horace one is free: https://twitter.com/magisterb480/status/1211663363551506432\\n* Check out podcasts and Latin videos on Youtube. I recommend especially looking at Latinitium's videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS3m8PITAWuADD9Nic1YOg (some are easier than others, poke around what interests you and don't worry about getting 100% comprehension)\\n* This is my favourite ScorpioMartianus video and I think it's pretty comprehensible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bv-nqVBewI\\n* Harry Potter and other translations are good if you know the original really well. If you don't then it'll probably be horrifying. The Latin isn't perfect, but it won't hurt you as long as it's not the only thing you ever read.\\n* The Vulgate is relatively easy if you already know the material pretty well.\\n* I don't know that *Ad Alpes* is necessarily easier than Roma Aeterna, but I like it. Maybe have a read if you get stuck in/tired of Roma Aeterna.\\n* This page has a lot of stuff on it, have a poke around: http://hiberna-cr.wikidot.com/reading-material\\n* Check out these dialogues which ScorpioMartianus has recorded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaQt4Ormzbs&amp;list=PLU1WuLg45Sixy5Me3wULYlzWiDFuHDIYv (I believe there are more things along similar lines on his Patreon which you might be interested in)\\n* Here are a bunch of 2 line poems with (relatively) constricted vocabulary (They can still be challenging): http://distichalatina.blogspot.com/\\n* Another list (note especially the myth/history readers pulled together from textbooks): http://johnpiazza.net/latin/online-reading/\\n* Legonium has (among other things) an ongoing series which is illustrated with Lego. You can get it as a lovely book version if you want: http://www.legonium.com/\\n* These are only 'easy' compared to really quite difficult classical literature, but maybe you'll want to take a look after Roma Aeterna, or if you're super interested in one of them: https://medium.com/in-medias-res/beach-reading-ten-easy-latin-works-e3bbe7bf6648\",\n",

But as your example shows, even many repeated readings won't fix this because after a while you're no longer learning, just wading through the same old bog on autopilot.

              "    'body': '*Memento mori* is the classic saying, and so I\\'ll copy-paste something I wrote on this phrase earlier:\\n\\nQuite literally, *Memento mori*  means \"remember to die\". But it sounds rather silly in English, as if  you forget it you\\'ll live forever. There are a few interpretations here:  *mori* is infinitive, but it can  be also be treated as a gerund when it\\'s a direct object, so then it  would be: \"Remember dying\" or \"keep in mind (the act of) dying\". It is also possible that it was an accusative + infinitive construction originally, *te mori*, but then *te* was dropped. *Memento te mori* \\\\- \"Remember you die\" or \"Remember that you die\".\\n\\nSo *memento mori* focuses on mortality, especially your own mortality - remember that you are going to die one day. *Memento mortem* is quite literally \"remember death\", as in \"remember that death exists\" or \"keep death in mind\".',\n",

You also run into patches where it seems like every sentence is missing the exact same word or even form of a word, like several in a row needing you to supply *mensam* after *supra* or *mensa* after *sub* or an *e* or *ex* in a sentence with *oriundus*, and this can be a little tedious when it's something you know well already.\\n\\nA lot of the sentences are contemporary and conversational, and there is some Christian Latin mixed in there, so it is one of a small minority of Latin courses that treats the language as something other than strictly ancient.\\n\\nWe are probably being a little generous in calling this a 'course', since it will not teach you much by itself, but I think it is a nice thing to do in addition to other Latin study.\\n\\nCertain things just 'click' with some people, so it's worth trying just to see if it happens to work for you and get you doing that little bit of extra study every day. I would say the same for Duolingo, or for a flashcard application or site like Anki or Quizlet. What initially got *me* studying every day was making my own flashcards in Mnemosyne (similar to Anki or SuperMemo), but no one I have recommended that to has ended up sticking with it.

              "    'body': 'Word order in Latin isn\\'t very important at all. In English, word order is everything. \"The dog bites the man,\" and \"The man bites the dog,\" are two entirely different sentences because the order of the words is different.  But in Latin it can be either \"Canis virum mordet,\" or \"Canis mordet virum,\" or \"Mordet canis virum,\" ect. and the sentences mean the same thing. \\n\\nIn any textbook Latin word order will usually keep to subject then object then verb. But in reality it can be in any order and still make sense. To put it simply, this is because Latin is an inflection language and therefore we can understand what a word is doing in a sentence by its ending and see if it is the subject or object of a sentence and the verb ending will also confirm and tells us what the subject is. So there isn\\'t a preferable version and you can choose which ever. Often in Latin poetry, word order is messed with to emphasis one word over the other by having it go before.',\n",

But, does the simple present actually mean you’re doing something at the time of speaking? If I say, “I eat meat,” no one imagines I am actually eating at the time. All that means is, “I am not a vegetarian. “ If I say “I’m eating meat now,” that should be a clear statement that I am eating meat at the moment, right? But, that could also mean, “I used to be a vegetarian, but nowadays I am back to eating meat.”\\n\\nEnglish has very formal “rules” about object pronouns (whom), not ending a sentence with a preposition, not splitting infinitives, etc, and these are best ignored almost all the time, except in those very situations in which you should not ignore them.\\n\\nIn English (and other languages) there’s a huge difference between, “He has few flaws,” and “he has a few flaws.” \\n\\nIn English, stress changes in an interesting way when a new compound concept starts to be considered a familiar single concept. People used to say “hotDOG” but now we say “HOTdog,” to give one example. \\n\\nAny linguist who knows anything about English knows that it has an interesting grammar just like any other language. \\n\\nAlso, your own post has a mistake. You should have said, “English grammar is,” not “English grammar it’s.” Also you should compare English grammar to Italian grammar, not English grammar to Italian. Your second sentence is not strictly incorrect, but does not sound like a native speaker wrote it, even if you replaced “English” with something like “chess.”',\n",

For example, in *Amici vocandi sunt (Friends must (should) be called), \"*vocandi\" is a nominative plural masculine gerundive, which describes \"amici\" (pl. nom.) In \"*Nomen amici vocandi Marcus est.\"(The name of the friend who must(should) be called is Marcus), \"*vocandi\" is a genitive singular masculine gerundive, which describes \"amici\" (sg. gen.)\\n\\nThe different cases of gerunds and gerundives have different meanings.',\n",

Not only does the vocabulary encompass archaic, Classical, Medieval, Renaissance, Neo-Latin and quite a few of Berard's own neologisms, the subject matter also encompasses Eastern religious doctrine (especially on the subject of re-incarnation and Nirvana), quantum physics, and information technology. I get exhausted trying to read about physics or IT in my native English, so I can't claim to have kept up with everything Berard was saying. Far from it. I also can't claim to have any idea whether Berard has any expertise in Eastern religion, or physics, or IT. I can say that I found the parts I understood to be dazzlingly good. (I can also definitely say: Cicero, this ain't!)\\n\\nI'm going to have to rest for a year or two, and then re-read both novels.

My mind is reeling. This is absolutely first-class literature. Would Pynchon approve? Yes, if Pynchon can read Latin.\\n\\nPraecursus -- so far, 100 pages in out of 445 -- could be described as a sort of an anti-Matrix: humans are being closely observed by immensely powerful machines, but the machines are benevolent. And also, they do not seem to have been made by humans.\\n\\nOn the topic of \"difficult\" reading: there is writing which is complex for no particular reason; there is that which is complex because the author is inept and does not know how to write plainly; there is pretentious writing -- and then there is that which is beautifully complex, and which rewards great effort on the reader\\'s part. I put the word \"difficult\" in quotes because I am convinced that the difficulty of a given text is relative. The more enjoyment a reader derives from a text, the less difficult the text will seem, even if it requires great exertion in order to be understood. And there\\'s no way to be certain that, just because A enjoys something, B will also enjoy it. And if they disagree, it doesn\\'t mean that A is right and B is wrong or vice-versa. Art is irreducably subjective -- or I am greatly mistaken. To compare the \"difficulty\" of a text to physical exertion: for one and the same person, walking for 100 yards may seem very difficult, or running for several hours may be pleasant, depending on a variety of physical, psychological, environmental and other factors.',\n",

The second, which starts at the fancy capital “E”, is from the Book of Lamentations, chapter 3, verse 1: “Ego vir videns paupertatem meam in virga indignationis eius” (“I am a man who sees my poverty by the rod of his indignation”).  It is the third reading from a church service called matins (or morning prayer) held on Good Friday, part of the original tenebrae service.  \\n\\nYou can read more about this and the structure of the service here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenebrae\\n\\nThe first sentence is a fragment of the second responsory (or chant) which the congregation (probably monks) would sing after the second reading and before the start of the third.  The part we see here is the last five words from the verse of that responsory: “Petrae scissae sunt, et monumenta aperta sunt, et multa corpora sanctorum qui dormierant, surrexerunt.” (“The rocks were split, and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who slept, arose.”).  This refers to the moment of Christ’s death on the cross. The chant from which it comes is known as the velum templi or “veil of the temple” which was torn in two at the same time, according to the gospel accounts.\\n\\nThe text in the image starts halfway through the fourth word of the Latin: “-rum qui dormierant, surrexerunt”.  \\n\\nSo, I would hazard a guess the page comes from a late medieval service book, which would originally have been used in worship during Holy Week.\\n\\nP.S.

Of course it's too facile to reduce all Latin to classical, but in order to learn other styles, I think it's a pre-requisite to define a starting point.

First, yes, dogmatically \"freezing\" the vocab of Latin at the fall of the Roman Empire just reïnforces the perception that it\\'s a dead language---well, really, at that point it\\'s no longer a perception, it\\'s a fact, because a dead language is one to which new words and new concepts are no longer being added, and new content is not being produced in quantity.  Second, those of us that *do* write and talk Latinly about modern life will use Steel Age words like «birotarius» and «autocinetum», and Atomic Age words like «computator», in addition to the Iron Age words with which we\\'re all familiar.  To turn around and say, well, we\\'re not going to use Dark Age/Middle Age words is essentially a denial of the evolution of languages, even as you\\'re proving the evolution of languages.\\n\\nThird, and I didn\\'t see you mention anything resembling this (whether or not because you disagree), adding to the Latin vocabulary also allows for so-called *elegant variation*.  I was taught that it\\'s bad form to use the same noun twice or more in a row to refer to the same thing; either you replace it with a pronoun, or you use a synonym.  If there\\'s only one word for the object to which «ræda» refers, well, so much for that idea.  A lot of authors (especially in English) will write an article, let\\'s say on the phænomenon of combustion, and you scan it and see \"fire... fire... fire... fire... fire\".  In fact, the Wikipedia article on fire uses that specific word 187 times, even in situations where \"flame\" would be fine, or \"combustion\", or \"breakaway oxidation\".',\n",

              "    'body': 'I think I may have some helpful input! Despite Latin not having an explicit system that differentiates between the progressive and simple present (like we do in English), there are some classes of verbs that can express different aspectual meanings. Allow me to explain. There are some verbs and verb-forms called \"frequentative\", meaning that the particular spelling of some verbs conveys an idea of the action the verb describes as frequently occurring.\\n\\nFor example, \"*Nam qui* \\\\[...\\\\] ***venditat*** *patriam\"* (Rhetorica ad Herennium, 15.23). The verb here \"*vendito*\" means \"to offer again and again for sale\" (definition from Lewis and Short). As opposed to a verb like \"*prodo*, *prodere*\" which in this context would just mean \"to sell\" without that sense of perpetuity/frequency. This same idea isn\\'t exclusive to the present however, for example \"*iactatus*\" conveys a frequentative meaning in the opening lines of the *Aeneid*.\\n\\nThere are also *inchoative* verbs, which expresses on an aspectual level the idea of \"entering or beginning a specific state\". In Latin, inchoative verbs have the root \"-sco\" in them, like *cresco* and *ardesco*. *Ardesco* (to kindle, to set aflame) is a good example because it is noticeably distinct from *ardeo* (to burn). \\n\\nI hope this is at all helpful.

You should be grateful for what it does have. As far as languages go, Latin is actually highly productive here. Old English, for example, has only two tenses.

              "    'body': \"To give you some context on what's going on, flavius belisarius clearly knows quite a bit about Latin, he is just not acknowledging the variation in Latin usage over the centuries, and specifically that the usage of the church can differ quite a bit from the Latin of Romans who lived in the time of Julius Caesar.\\n\\nFor instance, words like *creatura* and *producere*, which are quite similar to the English words *creature* and *produce*, would not have meant *creature* nor *produce* to a speaker of Latin living in Rome in the first century BCE. So if you're translating a text written by Caesar or one of his contemporaries, rendering *creatura* as *creature*, and *producere* as *produce* would be wrong. These are easy mistakes to make when you're a beginner in Latin, since the Latin and English words are so similar, and flavius belisarius is quite right to look out for them.\\n\\nHowever, Latin developed over the centuries. By the time the church came along and indeed became an important and powerful institution, some words had acquired new meanings. So in Christian texts, a word like *creature* often does mean *creature*, and *producere* does mean *produce*. In fact, the meaning of the English words *creature* and *produce* comes from the Latin words that they have been derived from.\\n\\nAs it happens, the Latin literature of the first century BCE has been hailed as the pinnacle of everything written in the language for centuries. Indeed, this period is known as the age of Classical Latin. As a result, many people have looked down upon Latin that adheres to usage and style standards of later centuries. This has been remedied somewhat nowadays, but Classical Latin is still often the basis for how Latin is taught. I think that goes some way to explaining why people here are quick to point out when someone is adhering too strictly to Classical Latin rules.\\n\\nSimilarly, a word like *dignatus* comes from a verb that had some variation in how its different grammatical forms were used. I won't bother you with the details, but the prayer uses one form, whereas flavius belisarius only acknowledges the other form as correct.\\n\\nFinally, I have to admit that I do not have a source at hand to verify that *cerevisa* is a correct alternative spelling of *cerevisia*, which means *beer*. However, the word *cerevisia* has variously been written as *cerevesia* and *cervesia*, so I personally wouldn't worry about another variant spelling.\\n\\n**edit:** That turned out to be a little more context than I intended, so feel free to ignore. But since you'd followed the discussion that far, I thought I might as well go into a little deeper.\",\n",

Knowing that use of the genitive and accusative with verbs of remembering and forgetting is always good, but the later response is absolutely right. Mortem is acc; mori is a deponent infinitive. (Unless you’re trying to remember a kind of tree ;) ) Unless I am mistaken, memento mori is the common phrase. The accusative with verbs of remembering is generally an older construction (Plautus, et al.); from Augustus onward, the genitive is more regular.

Verb tenses are the most complicated piece of Latin grammar, and at the moment it just doesn't really teach them at all. It just teaches the present tense. The assumption is that more content will be added, but it's clearly at most one third of the way there. It may be useful as a supplement for someone who is in their first semester of Latin or who wants a review of the basics, but it won't carry you very far.\\n\\nSome people are also driven up the wall by the emphasis it puts on weasels and parrots drunkenly cavorting and engaging in perfidious acts (not even joking). There are two issues. One is that parrot and weasel are not especially commonly used words in Latin. The second is that because they aren't commonly used, they are likely to trip people up when they are trying to test out of skills, so people who are pretty good at Latin end up having to do a lot of basic review just because they missed some simple words when they wouldn't if Duolingo used more common words like sheep or dog or bird as prominently as it uses parrot. I don't personally mind, as I believe that parrots and weasels were chosen because they are off the wall and drunken parrots are funnier than other kinds of drunken animals and it makes the sentences a bit more memorable to new learners, but I do understand the frustration.\",\n",

For some variety there\\'s *rem loqueris/fābulāris*, or more colloquially *est istuc quidem aliquid*, or less colloquially *probābiliter dīcis,* or stronger *bene ratiōcināris, prūdenter/sapienter loqueris*.\\n\\nThe opposite of the above, again, apart from the usual expressions of disagreement, is *nōn convenit/quadrat, id quod dīcis nōn constat, hau consentāneum est, vix ita* *~~mē~~* *mihi persuādēre possum* or stronger yet, *apsurda dīcis*.\\n\\nAs far as I can see, *sensum habēre* means \"to possess reason, be able to think and understand\", and *sensum facere* \"to result in discernible meaning, to be understandable\".\\n\\nIn short, I think the trick is to look through the ambiguous English phrase (as all such overused phrases tend to be) and try to grasp its precise meaning in the given context, at which point finding the right Latin expression becomes quite trivial.',\n",

For me at least, I think adhering to a canonical structure would make it virtually impossible to arrive at a satisfactory result. Then again, assuming this is exactly what you\\'ve achieved with \"Et Nīl Est\" and the like, that may just be because I\\'ve never tried, in which case, thank you for quite possibly giving me the impetus to attempt it!  Also, congratulations, because that\\'s quite a feat!\\n\\nOn the flip side, I\\'m not really convinced that it\\'s a bad idea to apply more modern literary forms to Latin.

It\\'s quite old, so there might be a few parts that I\\'d do a bit differently if I had the opportunity to re-record it, but it works at least well enough to show how I usually tackle Disney songs.\\n\\nOne of my more recent translations that hasn\\'t been sung yet is [\"Audiar\" (\"Speechless,\" from the 2019 remake of Aladdin)](https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/byoqcx/princess_jasmines_new_song_speechless_in_latin/).

Plus, it was the second day of the class, and my teacher taught us using Ecce Romani in the years leading up to AP Latin, so we didn’t have a ton of exposure to Vergil or poetry in general. But she was an amazing teacher, and she really helped us understand the Aeneid. There were 8 people in my AP Latin class, and no one scored below a 4 on the exam.

You can see a vestige of this in the English pronouns \"he\" (subject) and \"him\" (object). For this reason, you might also benefit from some basic grammar instruction before moving on to reading these bilingual books.

Aside from that, there are plenty of authors who have some favoured words that they use with a specific meaning.

              "    'body': '&gt;In an ideal world, having the meta-knowledge of grammar would indeed be irrelevant. However, the application of knowing, for example, the names for all the ablatives is something one encounters without fail in the contexts of both AP and IB programs as well as the general course of study throughout college. With a view toward composition of prose, knowing the ins and outs of declension and morphology as well as the correct grammatical situation for each case is also quite useful for students (but this is a corner case, at least in the US, with most prose composition courses limited to graduate school). If a teacher fails to teach these things rigorously then the students will fall to achieve at a higher level. Unless the academic expectations change wholesale, one has to teach the things which this example from Professor Bracey disregards. Teachers have to work within the system for students to succeed in relatively objective, standardized testing. This is, I agree, a bad thing for literacy and fluency.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;I am generally advising self-learners  from my own experiences and encounters with the US system and goals in  mind (AP Latin, Latin SAT subject test, IB, general college Latin  courses). I learned via Wheelock\\'s, taught at university with it, then  switched to the Intensive Course, which we used for the intensive summer  courses. Then, with the program I inherited, Our Latin Heritage was the  standard. Within our network (about 60 schools, 40 of which have robust  Latin programs), the data for the AP exam is that the LLPSI kids do  average (55% pass rates), the Cambrige, Wheelock\\'s or Latin for the New  Millennium do quite poorly (32%), and the OLH do the best (87%), so it  appears to be the right text for the system, i.e. for AP Latin  curriculum. However, there is the National Latin Exam ([NLE.org](https://nle.org/))  which tests a form of Latin that seems best covered by LLPSI, as it  asks for no grammar by name but rather for case/conjugation by context.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the petty nonsense we may disagree on, this is the real *gravamen* of the discussion and I am happy that we see eye to eye on this.\\n\\nNote, however, that I never said anything against objective, standardised testing (in principle).  I think it\\'s the only way to go (and I do mean standardised tests, scored by an exam board, not ad-hoc in-school exams, as tends to be the case in Canada).  I\\'m not even against \"working within the system\" or \"teaching to the test\", in principle.  The *caveat*, though, is that the subject matter under examination needs to be factually **useful.**  It also needs to be oriented in favour of **results** rather than process.\\n\\nI\\'ll use maths here as an example, specifically multiplication.  The traditional way is to stack two numbers, multiply every digit in the bottom number by every  digit in the top number, and do addition at the end. If you’re  multiplying two four-digit numbers, you end up performing sixteen smaller  multiplications to produce a final product.  In 1960, though, the Karatsuba Method was invented; it is just an alternative process for multiplication, so the product (by definition) is the same as with the traditional method, but it saves *a lot* of ink where large numbers are concerned.\\n\\nNow, if I sit a maths exam, get every answer right, but I get docked marks for using the Karatsuba Method, **that is a poorly designed exam**.  The skill under examination (i.e. multiplication) is a useful one to have, but since it doesn\\'t matter whether students do it the old way or the new way, they should be scored only on the correctness of the answer.\\n\\nA translation-based exam, to me at least, seems to be the best way to test Latin knowledge.  Possibly with a conversational component, to see how well students can think on the fly, but that\\'s my revivalistic instincts peeking through.',\n",

That\\'s almost by definition.  It is impossible to teach someone who\\'s never before been exposed to Latin from an article/poem/journal entry that wasn\\'t expressly written to teach them.

I also had a friend go through a  spoken Latin-only department at Kentucky, which was bizarre.\\n\\nLatin Immersion is a niche programme and, like all foreign-language Immersion courses, always will be.  As for Living Latin being esoteric, it depends on what is being meant.  I am a Living Latinist in the sense that I encourage students to read modern Latin compositions, and to learn the vocab for *light bulb, computer, car*, et cætera. \\n\\nSome people take it way too far, covering Elvis in Latin or doing the Lion King/Moana, but it\\'s no more esoteric, in my view, than Cheryl Lowe\\'s opinions on language.  Seriously, [you should read them](https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/natural-method-not-natural/).  In spite of *all the scientific research* demonstrating that the *only* evidence-based method for foreign-language acquisition is the Natural Method, she says this:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;Turning to the other two methods, #1 the grammar-first method and #2  the grammar-translation method, why is the former superior to the  latter? To begin with, the grammar-first method **is the traditional  method** that was used in the golden age of classical education, from the  Renaissance to the dawn of the 20th century. It is only in the last  century that the grammar-translation method began to supplant the  grammar-first method, a period which coincided with a drastic decline in  Latin learning.\\n\\nLet\\'s count the fallacies there.  Number one - appeal to tradition.  If something is \"traditional\", it must be the best, right?  Wrong.  Number two - correlation does not imply causation, and she says it does.\\n\\n&gt;In contrast, the grammar-first method focuses on and delights in the  grammar as an interesting subject in itself that does not need to be  rushed over in a hurry to get to translation, just as a good mathematics  program delights in and focuses on arithmetic rather than something to  be endured and rushed over in a hurry to get to algebra. \\n\\nAnyone who delights in grammar as an interesting subject in itself, well, *dico eum raram esse avem in terris*.\\n\\n&gt;**It is a failure of modern education** that lower order skills, such as  grammar and arithmetic, are denigrated and sacrificed for the higher  order skills of translation and higher math. This is a poor trade-off  that ultimately causes most students to reach a plateau in our two  difficult and cumulative subjects, languages and mathematics.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;There is a reason why non-Western cultures (particularly India,  China, Japan) consistently out-perform our students in mathematics. They  do not have our bias against memorization, drill, and basics. They  reach a higher level because they have the patience to build a strong  foundation.\\n\\nThey\\'re also flogging reprints of the old *Latin First/Second/Third/Fourth Year* books by Robert Henle, which for the record are not bad resources at all... but the way they\\'re being marketed makes me a bit sick to my stomach.\\n\\n&gt;Have you ever wondered what Latin books looked like before school texts were dumbed down? Originally published in 1945, the *Henle Latin Series* **teaches  Latin the traditional way**. \\xa0For students who are beginning Latin  studies in 9th grade or above, the first half of Henle I along with our *Teacher Manual* is the perfect beginning Latin program.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;*Henle* is a Catholic text, but its superiority as a teaching  resource and the outstanding benefits of its Christian perspective far  outweigh the very occasional picture or reference that a Protestant  might wish to ignore.\\n\\nI know Latinists tend to be on the conservative side; I am, as well, though I try to divorce the Latin language from Ancient Roman culture, so as to broaden the appeal of both.  By this I mean that a) Latin is a method of *communication* that can be used anywhere by anyone, at any time in history after its invention, and being \"typecast\" as \"the language of the Ancient Romans\" hampers its adoption in this regard; and b) lots of classicists are no good with languages and are using the degree as an ersatz Poli Sci course (in fact, in English universities, the default is to consider Poli Sci as just a different \"track\" of Greats).\\n\\nNotwithstanding any and all of the above, the unrelenting, fallacious appeals to tradition demonstrate two things about Memoria Press: *primo*, a frankly **stunning** degree of irony, given that the company apotheosises the trivium, which consists of grammar, rhetoric, and **logic**, and *secundo*, that they\\'ve cornered the market in reactionary troglodytes.\\n\\n&gt;Thanks for your perspective. It is  interesting to see a different point of view. I just hope we both agree  on the opposition to Google Translate and Duolingo Latin.\\n\\nBut of course.  It all has to do with the way Google\\'s artificial \"intelligence\" is best \"nourished\".  Essentially, Google feeds its computers with literature that has translations into many languages, and the A.I. gets **exponentially** smarter, a) the more languages that piece of literature is translated into and b) the more text is in its \"corpus\" for that particular language.  A 50,000 word document written in English, French, German, and Spanish is worth an order of magnitude more to the computer than a 20,000 document written in English and French.\\n\\nOne of the most useful works for Google Translate is, of course, the Bible; it has a Latin translation.  Even more useful, though, is European Union legislation... which is famously wordy (the Treaty of Lisbon, its more-or-less constitution, has 65,000 words) and published in 23 languages.  Unfortunately, none of those 23 languages is Latin, and until it\\'s added to the list, Google Translate will remain comparatively shitty.',\n",

              "    'body': 'My knowledge of any American curricula is absolutely *nil*, so excuse me if I seem to be arguing from a point of ignorance here.  I also was not, in any way, denigrating or de-prioritising \"translation and reading comprehension\"; in fact, I view that as **the cornerstone** of any foreign language course, Latin not excluded.\\n\\nThe typical high-school or university Latin exam in Britain is to be handed several extracts, half in English and half in Latin, and made to produce serviceable translations thereof.  From this standpoint, then, a focus on reading comprehension is paramount; you can\\'t translate the thing if you don\\'t understand it.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where you got the idea that I\\'m advocating matching the student\\'s fluency in Latin to his English ability.  This would only be possible in an immersion/bilingual environment from the call to post, and not many people are so blessed.  The professor mentioned the matching thing *obiter*, but the *ratio decidendi*, as it were, is that there is undue emphasis on what you called the meta-knowledge of grammar, to the detriment of comprehension.  On the other hand, it sounds like the professor\\'s trying to harmonise with a very American sort of political choir, one that focuses on skin colour as the key factor in group identity; this is a perspective I don\\'t share, nor does it play well in Canada or the UK in general.\\n\\nYou and I, on the other hand, might have the same ideal scene in mind.  In fact, I think we entirely agree so far as the pupil\\'s skills on exam day are concerned; where we seem to disagree is how that pupil is best produced.  My intuition tells me that the best way to acquire Latin is through consumption and production of material; that is, reading, translating, writing, more or less in that order.  In English, the **children\\'s** primer *par excellence* is \"Fun with Dick and Jane\", and the closest equivalent to that in the Latin language is «Lingua Latina per se Illustrata».  That, then, is what I suggest as one\\'s first classroom reader.\\n\\nAs for the meta-language of grammar bit, I\\'m not familiar enough with exam formats in the U.S.A. to be able to speak authoritatively.  Given an exam geared *totally* towards comprehension and translation, the student doesn\\'t need to know the **words** \"ablative absolute\", he simply needs to know how to use the actual **concept** in communication.  In such an environment, declension and morphology can be learned intuitively, then applied flawlessly, without *necessarily* knowing the terminology.   If, on the other hand, there are multiple-choice questions that depend upon the pupil\\'s knowledge of grammatical strictures, well, so much for that idea.\\n\\nMoving right along.  When the pupil feels confident enough to read non-didactic texts (books, articles, plays), he **must be encouraged in this** as a matter of priority.  Of course, all pupils must eventually move up to non-didactic matter; in a sense, the Latin language is its own reward.  This is where things **really** get interesting, because there\\'s the possibility of a cross-training effect, as you mentioned.  At this point in the language-acquisition \"gradient\", learning material either comes as long-form literature (with Latin it\\'s Horace, Ovid, Cicero, etc.) or anthologies of that same literature.  With a varied enough anthology, you very well might run into a situation where a pupil with an interest in regime change and coups asks for the works of Julius Cæsar as a means to indulging that interest... and while he\\'s indulging himself, he\\'s learning Latin.\\n\\nI can\\'t put too fine a point on that.  My own interest in science fiction was aroused by \"Lose Now, Pay Later\" by Carol Farley, a short story that was included in an anthology-format basal reader.  As far as English goes, there must be a myriad textbooks in this genre.  In the Latin language?  Nil.  [I had to formulate my own.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ztcJahCSTgpjNM-kfITgfOYbqOzCogtv)\\n\\nWhile many of the contributors to my homemade basal reader are affiliated with the Catholic Church (Claretian monks in particular), I\\'d hardly call it \"Vatican stuff\", given that the content is 100% secular, from the airport to the bank, Snow White to Jack and the Beanstalk.  It must be a stellar example of cosmic irony that the monks could write engaging, informative, and at times funny prose and poems (*pueri rident et discunt* after all!), while everything published by [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/latin/) (a Christian textbook publisher) is an industrial-strength soporific.  Cheryl Lowe should never have been allowed anywhere near a classroom.\\n\\nIn case you\\'re not familiar with Cheryl Lowe or the *Forms* Latin textbooks, she basically took the Grammar/Translation approach, and got rid of the translation.  That\\'s right, Grammar First.  She wasn\\'t satisfied with risking kids getting bored of Latin... she wanted to guarantee they **hate** it for the rest of their lives!\\n\\nRegardless, assuming four years of Latin instruction, I\\'d use LLPSI as the introductory text, Familia Romana plus my basal reader as the Year 2 texts, then the classics for Years 3 and 4.',\n",

              "    'body': \"I would find this valid if it were *totally* true. Is the OP trying to read for a hobby? Academics? \\n\\nThe focus of academic Latin in the US *is* for translation and reading comprehension. Anything else is almost disregarded or limited to JCL/ACL contests and hobbyists (mostly - there are living Latin groups, Vatican classes, University of Kentucky, cruises in Latin, etc.). While this focus on reading only is **terrible**, it only takes about 1.75 years of daily high school grammar instruction to get students reading through Caesar with ease; the grammar and morphology-based approach is not incompatible with reading. Another year or so and Cicero and Ovid are accessible. While this may not be entirely true in every setting, this has been a successful approach through my high school's honors program.\\n\\nIf you are starting with elementary children and working through graded readers, then yes, I suppose matching their current English skills and Latin skills would work, but by sophomore/junior year of high school, they are readily able to tackle tougher literature. Introducing juniors to Cicero while they are simultaneously in AP Language is a great way to reinforce rhetoric and style.  Critiquing the Aeneid as propaganda or learning about the Gallic suppression of information in DBG 6 while simultaneously reading 1984 in AP Literature is a perfect crossover.\\n\\nIn an ideal world, having the meta-knowledge of grammar would indeed be irrelevant. However, the application of knowing, for example, the names for all the ablatives is something one encounters without fail in the contexts of both AP and IB programs as well as the general course of study throughout college. With a view toward composition of prose, knowing the ins and outs of declension and morphology as well as the correct grammatical situation for each case is also quite useful for students (but this is a corner case, at least in the US, with most prose composition courses limited to graduate school). If a teacher fails to teach these things rigorously then the students will fall to achieve at a higher level. Unless the academic expectations change wholesale, one has to teach the things which this example from Professor Bracey disregards. Teachers have to work within the system for students to succeed in relatively objective, standardized testing. This is, I agree, a bad thing for literacy and fluency. \\n\\nWhile I do understand that Wheelock's is far and away the thinnest of the options I provided (and granted, 38 Latin Stories is a weak supplement), I still recommend reading it cover-to-cover as the Loci Antiqui and Loci Immutati (as well as the Wheelock's Latin Reader) are great springboards to reading fluency. Have you worked with either Latin: An Intensive Course or Our Latin Heritage? Both have extensive graded selections which really do exposes students to reading in a powerful way. Especially OLH 2, as it works through the variations of the Fabulae Faciles and a large survey of Caesar and other writers. While this may just be my experience from graduates coming out of our High School program, reading has been no problem for students doing 3 semesters of grammar/morphology/vocabulary with reading and then 5 semesters of reading/AP, so grain of salt and whatnot. \\n\\nIt is quite tough to teach a skill that ends up remaining mostly passive (reading) and rarely active (composition, conversation outside of Latin teacher meetups or University of Kentucky's grad program). However, the students who are really into the language will go above and beyond through extra curricular activities like JCL. Again this is biased toward a view at the US education system, with no active knowledge of any British curriculum (or Vatican stuff).\",\n",

              "    'body': 'I strenuously advise against the grammar-translation method of learning, and therefore texts that use this approach.  It is a fossil.  Wheelock\\'s is a good reference---but that\\'s what it is, a REFERENCE.  Keep it on the shelf, and refer to it when you get stuck, but this is not a book to read cover-to-cover.  Instead, focus on the communicative and comprehensive aspect.  The idea is to understand THE LANGUAGE, not the rules of that language as an intellectual exercise in themselves.  Begin with something like Orberg\\'s Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, then start adding Latin source material (either some of the more basic classical authors, or Neo-Latin articles from Palaestra Latina) and make sure you understand it fully.  Translation is a good exercise; it\\'s the essence of foreign language acquisition, that you can read material or hear speech and know what it means.  \\n\\nProfessor John Bracey explains much better than I ever could:\\n\\nFor centuries now, the default approach to teaching Latin has been the grammar-translation approach. This approach generally consists of learning grammar rules, learning grammar terminology, memorizing paradigms, and translating Latin into English primarily to demonstrate grammatical accuracy. When you boil it down, the emphasis is on memorization and application of abstract grammatical formulae. This approach takes a language that was once spoken comfortably by people of all backgrounds, social classes, ages, etc. throughout the world and renders it into a complex linguistic jigsaw puzzle that requires an elite mathematical mind to decipher.\\n\\nThe challenge that the grammar-translation approach poses to inclusivity is that it takes language, something universally accessible to all, and creates a series of unnecessary and onerous roadblocks that render it accessible to only the few. For example, using a comprehension-based approach, with no direct grammar instruction, all of my 7th grade students were able to read novice-level chapter books in Latin by the end of the year. With a grammar-based approach, those same results would be considered totally invalid unless accompanied by the ability to decline mixed-declension adjective-noun pairings, or to identify the difference between ablative of means and an ablative of manner.\"',\n",

If one sees languages as things which are constantly changing, and sees the change as a good thing, a natural and healthy thing, and thinks that the notion of \"correctness\" is arbitrary and must change with usage, then that will involve welcoming a constant growth of vocabulary, from slang, from other languages, from science and technology, from the use of the language by non-native speakers, etc. I\\'m convinced that the second alternative is much more fun, as well as more relevant to the actual use of the language by all who speak, hear, read and write it.

              "    'body': 'Works like Krebs\\' are normative, designed to give guidance to those who seek it. When people want to clarify a word\\'s usage, they don\\'t want Doederlein\\'s drunken haze philosophical treatise, they want brevity and clear recommendations. Krebs provides exactly that.\\n\\nWhen and to what degree to follow Kreb\\'s recommendations is up to the reader. Why they do and don\\'t want to follow them is also up to them. Krebs\\' is just one opinion, albeit a well-researched and authoritative one. There are enough explanations provided for the reader to be able to make some conclusions of their own, or at least have a starting point for further enquiry. The distinctions between what Cicero did and didn\\'t use should be employed to build a mental picture of how a word\\'s meaning developed, what usage was normal and what wasn\\'t.\\n\\nThe starting point of needing such a work is semantic bleaching. A word that in classical Latin might have been archaically, figuratively, colloquially, poetically, translationesely synonymous with another word gets used so often that it overtakes the default unmarked expression. This leaves a gap where the original marked expression was, which either makes the language poorer or requires an introduction of a substitute, which often creates another gap to be filled - this is the basis of constant semantic drift even when nothing new needs to be described.\\n\\nThis process obviously needs to be avoided in an ossified language whose sole purpose is to provide a maximally unchanging medium of communication. Nobody wants to learn a different Latin for every 200 years of texts written in it - you can knock yourself out doing that in enough languages already. Appealing to the inappropriateness of this approach in English is missing the whole point of Latin. How many people do you know who are incomprehensible because they\\'ve accidentally learned Tudor-era English? The history of Latin covers 5 times as long - if one needs an illustration of the semantic changes that amount of time results in when uninhibited, they need but open one of those Romance etymological dictionaries.\\n\\nEven to proponents of Living Latin, having a single well-defined standard is important, and as a dead language with little content being produced, it lacks the natural, social means for self-standardisation available to living languages. People who learn Latin tend to also be the erudite type prone to pass judgements on correctness, and it\\'s useful to have a reference to substantiate them and settle disputes.\\n\\nMost Latin-X dictionaries suck - one look at L&amp;S says it all. Even the En-La Smith &amp; Hall rarely bothers to do anything beyond giving a huge list of words that can possibly be translated the same. Add to that a century and a half of semantic shifts inside English itself, and most people end up thinking that half the Latin words can be synonymous, and themselves use whichever word from the list they happen to remember first. At worst they use the word that most resembles the one whose meaning they\\'re sure of in a modern language while having no idea about the meaning of the Latin one. Multiply this problem by the number of languages, false friends and bad dictionaries, and the result can be not far from the diversity (and utter wrongness from the point of view of Classical Latin) of New Latin pronunciations. A work like Krebs\\' provides a dirty but workable fix for this situation.\\n\\nThe writers who used the words Krebs recommends against using, were often doing so for special effect - Cicero with his neologising included. They had a programme and a rationale that they were following. In order to be able to recognise this rationale and perceive the diffences between what at first look in L&amp;S might appear to be synonyms, one needs to have a starting point - a firm grasp of what was most likely felt to be unmarked and idiomatic in the classical period. Krebs\\' work should be used as a tool to get this grasp.\\n\\nA reader who takes it to be the end of the journey and the definitive arbiter of style that everyone should unwaveringly follow can blame Krebs for strengthening their misconception about the nature of Latinity, but the misconception itself needs to have been there well before they\\'ve opened his book. Classical philology has been long plagued with what modern linguists recognise to be unscientific and socially-biased ideas (c.f. the whole \"Vulgar Latin\" conundrum), but that doesn\\'t mean that the resources the holders of these beliefs produced cannot be used to good results.',\n",

So don't be discouraged, and keep an eye out for these apparent anomalies.

It does this for several reasons. Firstly, the vast bulk of ancient Greek literature is written in Koine. Students who study Koine are well situated to access this material. Secondly, for those whose interest is primarily biblical and related studies, Koine is the idiom of primary interest. Thirdly, a significant portion of Koine writers deliberately and conscientiously employ a high-register of Koine that contains Attic features, for which reason you will find plenty of Attic influence in this text. Fourthly, the historical setting of the main storyline is late antiquity. I believe that students whose main interest is “classical literature” and “classical Greek” will still be well served by this text.\\n\\n&gt;That said, I do have in mind that LGPSI as a broader project of multiple stories may, indeed should, grow to include spin-off texts that may focus on specific authors/dialects/periods. That would include a ‘high Attic’, a Homeric book, a Byzantine one, and other possibilities.',\n",

If you are interested in the Greek of the Bible and similarly temporal texts, this is more than fine, but if you have any interest in the Attic Greek of Classical Athens, it's better to learn that first as Koine is effectively a much simplified form of it, so it's easier to read Koine texts because there is little new other than vocabulary.

I understand that two short /i/\\'s put together sounding like a long /ī/ make sense to you - what I\\'m asking about is: what does this fact tell you about the quality of the short /i/? Suppose short and long i\\'s sounded differently - what would they contract to in this case?\\n\\nAll right, I admit it, it was a trick question. The result would be the same, because:\\n\\n1. in the Classical period, antevocalic /i/ had the same quality as the long /ī/ because it was phonemically long, shortened by the general \"vocalis ante vocalem corripitur\" rule (*fīlī + us = fīlius*). For the same reason, the Romans heard the \\\\[ɪ\\\\~e\\\\] of Greek εια, and the same vowel in rustic Latin pronunciation of *via* as /ē/ (Varro\\'s *veha*) and transcribed it as such (*Aenēās, Alexandrēa*) until it was raised to \\\\[i\\\\] again in both languages (*Alexandrīa*).\\n2. even if it had contracted into the closest vowel still different from /ī/ - /ei/ - it would still be /ī/ in Classical Latin after the merger of /ei/ and /ī/ about 150 BC.\\n3. there\\'s no reason to believe nīl and mī contracted during the Classical period. Their original forms are *\\\\*nehīlum* and \\\\**mehei*. The former could have undergone simple elision of /e/; in the latter, neither vowel is original /i/; in any case, both could have contracted to /ei/ before merging with /i/. Both are thus potentially irrelevant to what a contraction of two i\\'s would result in in Classical Latin.\\n\\nAs for the English /ɪ/, you seem to have entirely misunderstood me. ɪ might be an IPA symbol, but it transcribes completely different vowels in different varieties of English - even when the transcription is supposed to be phonetic/narrow, included in square brackets! Allen\\'s vowel in \"bit\" was likely not the same as yours, as is still the case for almost all British English pronunciations - they lack the American vowel of \"bit\".\\n\\nThe reason that American vowel is transcribed with \\\\[ɪ\\\\] is tradition. In Californian English, as in many other American varieties, that vowel is a vowel between IPA \\\\[e\\\\], \\\\[ə\\\\] and \\\\[ɛ\\\\] - as can be seen in [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_diagram) or by googling \"english vowel diagram\" or \"space\". Vox Latina is talking about a vowel between IPA \\\\[i\\\\] and \\\\[e\\\\]. As most other descriptions in that book, it lacks scientific rigor and is merely an approximation - what sort of vowel Allen himself had in \"bit\" can only be guessed at from contemporary descriptions of RP. What Allen definitely didn\\'t mean, however, is the vowel you\\'re most likely to have in that word. When you or others try to argue against Allen\\'s \\\\[ɪ\\\\] for CL /i/, they\\'re a priori wrong because the vowel Allen is discribing is not the vowel they themselves pronounce. Australian English speakers, on the other hand, don\\'t tend to argue that becasue their /ɪ/ is close or identical to IPA \\\\[i\\\\]  - but their /i/ is a diphthong!\\n\\nThis is the reason I\\'m saying that English has no one single pronunciation of the vowel in \"bit\", or any other single vowel, regardless of how these vowels are traditionally transcribed, and that anyone who describes Latin pronunciation by referencing the vowels of English is a priori wrong: there\\'s neither one English, nor one English vowel system.',\n",

Poetic license allows scanning them as two syllables, but since native Latin phonotactics don\\'t allow vowel hiatus, you\\'ll have to fill it with some sort of a glide, or perhaps even an /h/, or pronounce the second vowel differently from the first, which becomes the glide.

I do love Latin because of the concise nature of it, even if I don't get the meaning of the words yet, I know that this verb is being done by this noun, because there's no ambiguity, at least not any I've had to deal with yet! One specific thing I've discovered and find very interesting is the presence of hoc this, iste  that (nearby in space, time, or in the sentence), and ille that (further away). I'm fairly confident that's the correct order, although it may be that I'm mixing iste/ille up. It's interesting that English doesn't differentiate here, and it's not likely that I ever would have thought of the concepts if not for Latin. \\n\\nAs far as the cases go, I get it mostly. Nom: subject, gen: ownership/relationship, dat: to or for, acc: direct object, and abl: by/with/from/in/on. I don't have all the different endings memorized, except for the first declension, primarily feminine. I'd like to at least get the basic endings down before I dedicate my time fully to LLPSI, and now I have the classroom reader to incorporate at some point, so I have a long way to go as of yet, but progress is happening!

It ends up being becoming French *faire*, Italian *fare*, and Spanish *hacer*, if you happen to be familiar with any of those. In this case, its subject is Aemilia, and the object is *gradum*. In general, its usage will often be pretty idiomatic, so don\\'t bother trying to translate it too literally. After all, in English, when we say \"take a step\", does \"take\" really mean anything here? How could you possibly take a step and bring it somewhere else? \\n\\nAs a fun fact, *facio* ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root **dʰeh₁-*, which is also the origin of English *do*.',\n",

There's no such thing as a natural word order, there's just more or less flexibility.

Also English is mostly right-binding, with the notable exception of verb phrases.\",\n",

              "    'body': '\"Integralism\" is not a Latin word. However, I can explain what it means broken down into its roots, if that\\'s what you mean.\\n\\n\"Integralism\" comes, of course, from the adjective \"integral\". The word \"integral\" comes from Latin *integrālis*, formed from the suffix *-ālis* (pertaining to) and the word \"*integer*\", meaning \"whole\" or \"intact\" (in English, an integer in math is a whole number - a number not broken down into fractions). Within the Latin language, this word doesn\\'t break down any further, but we can trace it further back up its lineage to find a deeper root meaning. The word \"*integer*\" derives from the word *entagros*, from earlier *ntagros*, in Proto-Italic, the reconstructed mother language of Latin and other old italic languages. The prefix \"n-\" (later \"en-\") means \"not\" - it developed into our prefix \"in-\" with the same meaning (compare, for example, \"inaccessible\" - literally, \"not accessible\"). The root \"-tagros\" is of the same origin as the Latin verb *tangere* \"to touch\" (compare \"tangible\" in English - literally, \"touchable\"). So, *ntagros* meant \"untouched\". Latin *integer* came to mean \"whole, intact\" as an extended meaning from this. Its semantic development looks something like this: untouched &gt; unharmed &gt; unbroken &gt; intact. On another note, there is another Latin word of the same origin which underwent the same semantic shift - the word \"intact\" itself. \"Intact\" comes from Latin *intāctus*, from *in-* \"not\" + *tāctus* \"touched\" - *tāctus* is a participle form of the very same Latin *tangere* (compare in English \"tactile\" - literally, \"pertaining to touch\"), meaning that *intactus* and *integer* are essentially parallel formations within the same language. \\n\\nSo then, where did \"integral\" get its meaning? Well, since \"*integer*\" in Latin came to mean \"whole\", combining it with the suffix *-ālis* gave it the meaning \"complete\" or \"constituting a whole\". Add the suffix \"-ism\" (\"-ism\" basically just makes abstract nouns from qualities) and you get something to the effect of, \"the concept of constituting a whole\".',\n",

This involves reading considerably slower than you do, and probably also diving sentences in smaller segments.

Long vowels seem to be most often preserved on word ends in ablatives. The other issue is that nasalisation is too weak, sometimes I don't hear it at all. Also, Latin doesn't allow phonetic words of less than two moras, so all letter names end in long vowels or in consonans (ā, bē, cē etc). Most of the other basics seem really solid to me. Use [these pronunciations](https://forvo.com/user/Sobakus/) as a guide.\",\n",

If the Latin were perfectly complete, it might go something like “optima quaeque sit honesta,” where we use the subjunctive sit instead of the indicative est because quae introduces a subordinate clause.

              "    'body': \"From the same time as Jerome, we can't forget Augustine's *Confessiones*, often considered the first Western autobiography.  \\n\\nThomas Aquinas' *Summa Theologiae* (or *Summa Theologica*) was the capstone of Scholastic theology, and philosophy as well (since he saw that philosophy, along with all other sciences, are *ancillae* of theology).\\n\\nIn the realm of science, there's also Copernicus' *De revolutionibus orbium coelestium*, which launched the Copernican Revolution.\\n\\nA fun bonus: if you want to see early concrete poetry, look up Rabanus Maurus' *De laudibus sanctae crucis*.  It's a set of Latin poems arranged in squares, with additional designs added on top, and the letters within the designs form sub-poems within the larger poem.  For instance, it opens with [this poem](https://www.facsimilefinder.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-Hraban-Ludwig.jpg), dedicated to the Emperor.  An image of the Emperor is imposed on the poem, and different parts of the picture form new poems.  For instance, the Emperor's crown reads *Tu, Hludovicum, Christe, corona*, and his shield holds a pair of elegiac couplets:\\n\\n*Nam scutum fidei depellit tela nefanda,*\\n\\n*Protegit Augustum clara tropaea parans*\\n\\n*Devotum pectus divino munere fretum*\\n\\n*Illaesum semper castra inimica fugat*.\\n\\nThankfully, Rabanus wrote a commentary which spells out each of these sub-poems, in case you have trouble tracking the letters.\",\n",

Classical choral pieces were by and large written as religious works, so they used the Latin of the Catholic Church, the *Ecclesia*. This manner of pronunciation coincides more closely with modern Italian. This means that \"c\" and \"g\" are pronounced as soft /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ (the English sounds \"ch\" and \"j\") respectively before \"e\" and \"i\", and the consonant \"v\" is always pronounced /v/ as in English. The digraphs \"ae\" and \"oe\" are both pronounced as an \"eh\" sound, as you mentioned, and short vs. long vowels are not distinguished. \\n\\nThis is how the Church speaks Latin, and it was for this kind of Latin that your piece was written, so you should indeed pronounce it as such for your choir. This was not, however, how the ancient Romans actually spoke. In the classical pronunciation, \"ae\" and \"oe\" are pronounced /ae̯/ and /oe̯/ (close to \"eye\" and \"oy\" in English), \"c\" and \"g\" are always pronounced as hard /k/ and /g/, even before \"e\" and \"i\",  and the consonant \"v\" is pronounced like a \"w\" always. Vowel length is phonemic, meaning that, often times, a long vowel has a different sound quality from its short equivalent (for example, short \"u\" is pronounced /ʊ/, while long \"ū\" is pronounced /uː/) meaning *malum* (bad) and *mālum* (apple) were distinct in pronunciation, one with a short \"a\" and the other with a long \"a\".',\n",
