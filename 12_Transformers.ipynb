        "# Introducing Semantic Search\n",
        "\n",
        "Information retrieval is a large and complicated field. In this notebook, we'll look at the steps involved in a specific information retrieval algorithm called \"semantic search,\" which employs a language model to compare the similarity of a search query to chunks of original data. The steps are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Load our model\n",
        "* Read in and chunk our data\n",
        "* Embed the chunks\n",
        "* Take in and embed our user query\n",
        "* Take the dot product between our user query and our document embeddings\n",
        "* Align relevant indices with original chunked data\n",
        "* Return chunks to the user or another process\n",
        "\n",
        "At the end of the notebook, we'll pass this information that we retrieved to an LLM and complete a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Some key concepts in semantic search\n",
        "**Masked Language Modeling**: The type of language modeling that we use when we are doing semantic search may seem confusing because it is unlike the modeling we have done in other notebooks. That said, it is more similar that it might seem. As we will see, these models which we use for this task take in a string (usually representing a sentence or paragraph) and output a vector of numbers. Unlike other forms of artificial intelligence, these models do not produce more text or images, rather they tell us the way they interpret language. The vectors and matrices that these models produce (called embeddings) represent how this model understands the text we give it. In training, as opposed to predicting the next token, they are given a full sentence with a random assortment of words in it masked with a special token. The model then has to guess at these masked words. This type fo training gives the models an internal sense of semantic meaning that is more accurate to human understanding than predicting the next word in a sequence of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dot Product**\n",
        "Once we have generated embeddings for our source documents and our query string, we need some way of comparing them. We would like a function that took in a vector and a matrix of specific sizes and return how similar each row of the matrix is to the vector. Thankfully, in linear algebra, this exact function exists. It is called the \"dot product\" (we will be using the \"scaled dot product\"). Given a vector, $V$, of size (1, N) and a matrix, $M$, of (M, N), $V \\cdot M^{T}$ will return a row vector if size (M, 1). Each element of this new vector will be a score for -1 to 1 (CHECK) which represents how similar $V$ was to a row in $M$. More details to follow.\n"

They consisted of four hundred thousand horse and foot,                 The _iron cage_ in which Bajazet was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so long and so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as a fable by the modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity.   Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and grandson, nineteen years after his decease;                       From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may be deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits were harmonized by success, affected the character of generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just and vehement; and Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a wagon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution. Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Persia; and Bajazet was condemned to represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman C\\u00e6sar     From the Irtish and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the Ganges to Damascus and the Archipelago, Asia was in the hand of Timour: his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless, and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the Christian kingdoms of the West, which already trembled at his name. He touched the utmost verge of the land; but an insuperable, though narrow, sea rolled between the two continents of Europe and Asia;       \",\n          \"When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each private citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the magistrate, and the whole community, are the guardians of his personal safety. But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honorable, and often meritorious: the independent warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy, whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate, conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood.           The civil and military professions, which had been separated by Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke, of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed, within his district, the command of the troops, and the administration of justice.       But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior credit and authority, among a warlike people, who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward deserved to live.           A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One third part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul.         The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their extensive domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of the villas, or rural palaces, in which they successively resided.  One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim the honors of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms. The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables, for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labors of agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign; his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private economy.           In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the appellation of Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and a license to oppress, the subjects of their peculiar territory. Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal: but the laws were extinguished; and the sacrilegious Barbarians, who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or bishop,         According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared:         The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family. Auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the independent states and cities of Gaul. The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy; the sword of Caesar himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls of Gergovia.             \",\n          \"The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius, which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance, was justly exasperated by the tumults of his capital, and the criminal behavior of a faction, which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign. The ordinary punishments of death, exile, and confiscation, were inflicted with partial vigor; and the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks, a reader, and a sub-deacon, who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes, and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople. By an edict of Constantius against the Catholics which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodosian code, those who refused to communicate with the Arian bishops, and particularly with Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics, and of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches; and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city. The execution of this unjust law, in the provinces of Thrace and Asia Minor, was committed to the zeal of Macedonius; the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands; and the cruelties exercised by this Semi- Arian tyrant in the support of the _Homoiousion_, exceeded the commission, and disgraced the reign, of Constantius. The sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims, who denied the vocation, and abhorred the principles, of Macedonius. The rites of baptism were conferred on women and children, who, for that purpose, had been torn from the arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine, while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot egg-shells, or inhumanly compressed betweens harp and heavy boards.       While the flames of the Arian controversy consumed the vitals of the empire, the African provinces were infested by their peculiar enemies, the savage fanatics, who, under the name of _Circumcellions_, formed the strength and scandal of the Donatist party.       Such disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny, but the rage of the Donatists was inflamed by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind; and which, if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age. Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of little moment by what means, or by what hands, they perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope of eternal happiness.   The simple narrative of the intestine divisions, which distracted the peace, and dishonored the triumph, of the church, will confirm the remark of a Pagan historian, and justify the complaint of a venerable bishop.

Gratus, bishop of Carthage, begins the acclamations of an orthodox synod, \\u00d2Gratias Deo omnipotenti et Christu Jesu... qui imperavit religiosissimo Constanti Imperatori, ut votum gereret unitatis, et mitteret ministros sancti operis _famulos Dei_ Paulum et Macarium.\\u00d3 Monument.

Constantin. l. ii. c. 45,) the emperor prohibited, both in cities and in the country, the abominable acts or parts of idolatry. l Socrates (l. i. c. 17) and Sozomen (l. ii. c. 4, 5) have represented the conduct of Constantine with a just regard to truth and history; which has been neglected by Theodoret (l. v. c. 21) and Orosius, (vii. 28.) Tum deinde (says the latter) primus Constantinus _justo_ ordine et _pio_ vicem vertit edicto; siquidem statuit citra ullam hominum c\\u00bedem, paganorum templa claudi.'), ('165', 'See Eusebius in Vit. Constantin. l. ii. c. 56, 60. In the sermon to the assembly of saints, which the emperor pronounced when he was mature in years and piety, he declares to the idolaters (c. xii.) that they are permitted to offer sacrifices, and to exercise every part of their religious worship.'), ('166', 'See Eusebius, in Vit. Constantin. l. iii. c. 54-58, and l. iv. c. 23, 25.

Constan. l. iii. c. 54-58) and Libanius (Orat. pro Templis, p. 9, 10, edit. Gothofred) both mention the pious sacrilege of Constantine, which they viewed in very different lights. The latter expressly declares, that \\u00d2he made use of the sacred money, but made no alteration in the legal worship; the temples indeed were impoverished, but the sacred rites were performed there.\\u00d3 Lardner\\u00d5s Jewish and Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 140.'), ('168', 'Ammianus (xxii. 4) speaks of some court eunuchs who were spoliis templorum pasti. Libanius says (Orat. pro Templ. p. 23) that the emperor often gave away a temple, like a dog, or a horse, or a slave, or a gold cup; but the devout philosopher takes care to observe that these sacrilegious favorites very seldom prospered.'), ('169', 'See Gothofred.

Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. x. leg. 4. Chronology has discovered some contradiction in the date of this extravagant law; the only one, perhaps, by which the negligence of magistrates is punished by death and confiscation. M. de la Bastie (M\\u017dm. de l\\u00d5Acad\\u017dmie, tom. xv. p. 98) conjectures, with a show of reason, that this was no more than the minutes of a law, the heads of an intended bill, which were found in Scriniis Memori\\u00be among the papers of Constantius, and afterwards inserted, as a worthy model, in the Theodosian Code.'), ('171', 'Symmach. Epistol. x. 54.'), ('172', 'The fourth Dissertation of M. de la Bastie, sur le Souverain Pontificat des Empereurs Romains, (in the M\\u017dm. de l\\u00d5Acad. tom. xv. p. 75- 144,) is a very learned and judicious performance, which explains the state, and prove the toleration, of Paganism from Constantino to Gratian. The assertion of Zosimus, that Gratian was the first who refused the pontifical robe, is confirmed beyond a doubt; and the murmurs of bigotry on that subject are almost silenced.'), ('173', 'As I have freely anticipated the use of _pagans_ and _paganism_, I shall now trace the singular revolutions of those celebrated words. 1. in the Doric dialect, so familiar to the Italians, signifies a fountain; and the rural neighborhood, which frequented the same fountain, derived the common appellation of _pagus_ and _pagans_. (Festus sub voce, and Servius ad Virgil. Georgic. ii. 382.) 2. By an easy extension of the word, pagan and rural became almost synonymous, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xxviii. 5;) and the meaner rustics acquired that name, which has been corrupted into _peasants_ in the modern languages of Europe. 3. The amazing increase of the military order introduced the necessity of a correlative term, (Hume\\u00d5s Essays, vol. i. p. 555;) and all the _people_ who were not enlisted in the service of the prince were branded with the contemptuous epithets of pagans. (Tacit. Hist. iii. 24, 43, 77. Juvenal. Satir. 16. Tertullian de Pallio, c. 4.) 4. The Christians were the soldiers of Christ; their adversaries, who refused his _sacrament_, or military oath of baptism might deserve the metaphorical name of pagans; and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian (A. D. 365) into Imperial laws (Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18) and theological writings. 5. Christianity gradually filled the cities of the empire: the old religion, in the time of Prudentius (advers. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Orosius, (in Pr\\u00befat. Hist.,) retired and languished in obscure villages; and the word _pagans_, with its new signification, reverted to its primitive origin. 6. Since the worship of Jupiter and his family has expired, the vacant title of pagans has been successively applied to all the idolaters and polytheists of the old and new world. 7. The Latin Christians bestowed it, without scruple, on their mortal enemies, the Mahometans; and the purest _Unitarians_ were branded with the unjust reproach of idolatry and paganism. See Gerard Vossius, Etymologicon Lingu\\u00be Latin\\u00be, in his works, tom. i. p. 420; Godefroy\\u00d5s Commentary on the Theodosian Code, tom. vi. p. 250; and Ducange, Medi\\u00be et Infim\\u00be Latinitat. Glossar.'), ('174', 'In the pure language of Ionia and Athens were ancient and familiar words. The former expressed a likeness, an apparition (Homer. Odys. xi. 601,) a representation, an _image_, created either by fancy or art. The latter denoted any sort of _service_ or slavery. The Jews of Egypt, who translated the Hebrew Scriptures, restrained the use of these words (Exod. xx. 4, 5) to the religious worship of an image. The peculiar idiom of the Hellenists, or Grecian Jews, has been adopted by the sacred and ecclesiastical writers and the reproach of _idolatry_ has stigmatized that visible and abject mode of superstition, which some sects of Christianity should not hastily impute to the polytheists of Greece and Rome.')]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

They consisted of four hundred thousand horse and foot,                 The _iron cage_ in which Bajazet was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so long and so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as a fable by the modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity.   Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and grandson, nineteen years after his decease;                       From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may be deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits were harmonized by success, affected the character of generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just and vehement; and Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on a wagon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigorous precaution. Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Persia; and Bajazet was condemned to represent the person, and expiate the guilt, of the Roman C\\u00e6sar     From the Irtish and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the Ganges to Damascus and the Archipelago, Asia was in the hand of Timour: his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless, and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the Christian kingdoms of the West, which already trembled at his name. He touched the utmost verge of the land; but an insuperable, though narrow, sea rolled between the two continents of Europe and Asia;       \",\n          \"When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each private citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the magistrate, and the whole community, are the guardians of his personal safety. But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge was always honorable, and often meritorious: the independent warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy, whom he had sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate, conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine which had been ascertained as the price of blood.           The civil and military professions, which had been separated by Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles of Duke, of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed, within his district, the command of the troops, and the administration of justice.       But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior credit and authority, among a warlike people, who could not believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward deserved to live.           A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had formerly passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One third part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom he had invited to share the rich harvest of Gaul.         The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their extensive domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of the villas, or rural palaces, in which they successively resided.  One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim the honors of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed only in the light of profitable farms. The mansion of the long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and stables, for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labors of agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign; his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the strictest maxims of private economy.           In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a new order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the appellation of Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and a license to oppress, the subjects of their peculiar territory. Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an equal: but the laws were extinguished; and the sacrilegious Barbarians, who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or bishop,         According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared:         The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family. Auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the independent states and cities of Gaul. The brave and numerous inhabitants displayed a singular trophy; the sword of Caesar himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls of Gergovia.             \",\n          \"The cruel and arbitrary disposition of Constantius, which did not always require the provocations of guilt and resistance, was justly exasperated by the tumults of his capital, and the criminal behavior of a faction, which opposed the authority and religion of their sovereign. The ordinary punishments of death, exile, and confiscation, were inflicted with partial vigor; and the Greeks still revere the holy memory of two clerks, a reader, and a sub-deacon, who were accused of the murder of Hermogenes, and beheaded at the gates of Constantinople. By an edict of Constantius against the Catholics which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodosian code, those who refused to communicate with the Arian bishops, and particularly with Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of ecclesiastics, and of the rights of Christians; they were compelled to relinquish the possession of the churches; and were strictly prohibited from holding their assemblies within the walls of the city. The execution of this unjust law, in the provinces of Thrace and Asia Minor, was committed to the zeal of Macedonius; the civil and military powers were directed to obey his commands; and the cruelties exercised by this Semi- Arian tyrant in the support of the _Homoiousion_, exceeded the commission, and disgraced the reign, of Constantius. The sacraments of the church were administered to the reluctant victims, who denied the vocation, and abhorred the principles, of Macedonius. The rites of baptism were conferred on women and children, who, for that purpose, had been torn from the arms of their friends and parents; the mouths of the communicants were held open by a wooden engine, while the consecrated bread was forced down their throat; the breasts of tender virgins were either burnt with red-hot egg-shells, or inhumanly compressed betweens harp and heavy boards.       While the flames of the Arian controversy consumed the vitals of the empire, the African provinces were infested by their peculiar enemies, the savage fanatics, who, under the name of _Circumcellions_, formed the strength and scandal of the Donatist party.       Such disorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny, but the rage of the Donatists was inflamed by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind; and which, if it really prevailed among them in so extravagant a degree, cannot surely be paralleled in any country or in any age. Many of these fanatics were possessed with the horror of life, and the desire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of little moment by what means, or by what hands, they perished, if their conduct was sanctified by the intention of devoting themselves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope of eternal happiness.   The simple narrative of the intestine divisions, which distracted the peace, and dishonored the triumph, of the church, will confirm the remark of a Pagan historian, and justify the complaint of a venerable bishop. The experience of Ammianus had convinced him, that the enmity of the Christians towards each other, surpassed the fury of savage beasts against man;     A modern writer, who, with a just confidence, has prefixed to his own history the honorable epithets of political and philosophical,           The sons of Constantine trod in the footsteps of their father, with more zeal, and with less discretion. The pretences of rapine and oppression were insensibly multiplied;           The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of _Paganism;_   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7880,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The whole republic is fatigued and exhausted.\",\n          \"During the same period of persecution, the zealous, the eloquent, the ambitious Cyprian governed the church, not only of Carthage, but even of Africa.\",\n          \"The next spring, his favorite general, Alexius Strategopulus, whom he had decorated with the title of C\\u00e6sar, passed the Hellespont with eight hundred horse and some infantry,             After this narrative of the expeditions of the Latins to Palestine and Constantinople, I cannot dismiss the subject without resolving the general consequences on the countries that were the scene, and on the nations that were the actors, of these memorable crusades.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

on two measures, the one dictated by policy, the other by\\u003cbr\\u003edecency; the revenge, and the honors, due to the memory of Pertinax.\"],[\"Before the new emperor entered Rome, he issued his commands to the Pr\\u00e6torian guards, directing them\\u003cbr\\u003eto wait his arrival on a large plain near the city, without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in\\u003cbr\\u003ewhich they were

hundred miles from the capital.\"],[\"During the transaction, another detachment had been sent to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and\\u003cbr\\u003eprevent the hasty consequences of their

offend us\\u003cbr\\u003ewith a less degrading idea of meanness, than when they are found in the intercourse of private life.\"],[\"In the latter, they discover a want of courage; in the other, only a defect of power: and, as it is\\u003cbr\\u003eimpossible for the most able statesmen to subdue millions of followers and enemies by their own\\u003cbr\\u003epersonal strength, the world, under the name of policy, seems to have granted them a very liberal\\u003cbr\\u003eindulgence of craft and dissimulation.\"],[\"Yet the arts of Severus cannot be justified by the most ample privileges of state reason.\"],[\"He promised only to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however he might occasionally bind\\u003cbr\\u003ehimself by oaths and treaties, his conscience, obsequious to his interest,

fall of the republic, combated only for the choice of masters.\"],[\"Under the standard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enlisted from affection, some from fear,\\u003cbr\\u003emany from interest, none from principle.\"],[\"The legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were allured into civil war by liberal donatives, and still\\u003cbr\\u003emore liberal promises.\"],[\"A defeat, by disabling the chief from the performance of his engagements, dissolved the mercenary\\u003cbr\\u003eallegiance of his followers, and left them to consult their own safety by a timely desertion of

power, and as soon as that power yielded to a superior\\u003cbr\\u003eforce, they hastened to implore the clemency of the conqueror, who, as he had an immense debt to\\u003cbr\\u003edischarge, was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty countries to the avarice of his soldiers.\"],[\"In the vast extent of the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities capable of protecting a\\u003cbr\\u003erouted army; nor was there any person, or family, or order of men, whose natural interest,\\u003cbr\\u003eunsupported by the powers of government, was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking party.\"],[\"Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city deserves an honorable exception.\"],[\"As Byzantium was one of the greatest passages from Europe into Asia, it had been provided with a\\u003cbr\\u003estrong garrison, and a fleet of five hundred vessels was anchored in the harbor.\"],[\"Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in their flight from the field of battle.\"],[\"Their fate excited neither surprise nor compassion.\"],[\"They had staked their lives against the chance of empire, and suffered what they would have\\u003cbr\\u003einflicted; nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his rivals to live in a\\u003cbr\\u003eprivate station.\"],[\"But his unforgiving temper, stimulated by avarice, indulged a spirit of revenge, where there was no\\u003cbr\\u003eroom for apprehension.\"],[\"The most considerable of the provincials, who, without any dislike to the fortunate candidate, had\\u003cbr\\u003eobeyed the governor under whose authority they were accidentally placed, were punished by death,\\u003cbr\\u003eexile, and especially by the confiscation of their estates.\"],[\"Many cities of the East were stripped of their ancient honors, and obliged to pay, into the treasury\\u003cbr\\u003eof Severus, four times the amount of the sums contributed by them for the service of Niger.\"],[\"Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was, in some measure, restrained by the\\u003cbr\\u003euncertainty of the event, and his pretended reverence for the senate.\"],[\"The head of Albinus, accompanied with a menacing letter, announced to the Romans that he was\\u003cbr\\u003eresolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate competitors.\"],[\"He was irritated by the just auspicion that he had never possessed the affections of the senate, and\\u003cbr\\u003ehe concealed his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some treasonable correspondences.\"],[\"Thirty-five senators, however, accused of having favored the party of Albinus, he freely pardoned,\\u003cbr\\u003eand, by his subsequent behavior, endeavored to convince them, that he had forgotten, as well as\\u003cbr\\u003eforgiven, their supposed offences.\"],[\"But, at the same time, he condemned forty-one         The true interest of an absolute

greatness; and were he totally devoid of virtue, prudence might supply its place, and would\\u003cbr\\u003edictate the same rule of conduct.\"],[\"Severus considered the Roman empire as his property, and had no sooner secured the possession, than\\u003cbr\\u003ehe bestowed his care on the cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition.\"],[\"Salutary laws, executed with inflexible firmness, soon corrected most of the abuses with which,\\u003cbr\\u003esince the death of Marcus, every part of the government had been infected.\"],[\"In the administration of justice, the judgments of the emperor were characterized by attention,\\u003cbr\\u003ediscernment, and impartiality; and whenever he deviated from the strict line of equity, it was\\u003cbr\\u003egenerally in favor of the poor and oppressed; not so much indeed from any sense of humanity, as from\\u003cbr\\u003ethe natural propensity of a despot to humble the pride of greatness, and to sink all his subjects to\\u003cbr\\u003ethe same common level of absolute dependence.\"],[\"His expensive taste for building, magnificent shows, and above all a constant and liberal\\u003cbr\\u003edistribution of corn and

an intermediate power, however imaginary, between the emperor and the army.\"],[\"He disdained to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his person and trembled at\\u003cbr\\u003ehis frown; he issued his commands, where his requests would have proved as effectual; assumed the\\u003cbr\\u003econduct and style of a sovereign and a conqueror, and exercised, without disguise, the

the presence of the\\u003cbr\\u003efierce and undisciplined multitude, over whom he had assumed the command; his military talents were\\u003cbr\\u003edespised, and his personal courage suspected; a whisper that circulated in the camp, disclosed the\\u003cbr\\u003efatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor, aggravated the guilt of murder by the\\u003cbr\\u003ebaseness of hypocrisy,

restored health and vigor to the Roman army in an easy and almost imperceptible manner.\"],[\"To the soldiers already engaged in the service, he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges\\u003cbr\\u003eand extravagant pay given by Caracalla; but the new recruits were received on the more moderate\\u003cbr\\u003ethough liberal establishment of Severus, and gradually formed to modesty and obedience.\"],[\"The empress Julia had experienced all the vicissitudes of fortune.\"],[\"From an humble station she had been raised to greatness, only to taste the superior bitterness

young conqueror announced his victory to the obedient senate were\\u003cbr\\u003efilled with professions of virtue and moderation; the shining examples of Marcus and Augustus, he\\u003cbr\\u003eshould

he\\u003cbr\\u003etacitly asserted his hereditary claim to the empire; but, by assuming the tribunitian and\\u003cbr\\u003eproconsular powers before they had been conferred on him by a decree of the senate, he offended the\\u003cbr\\u003edelicacy of Roman prejudice.\"],[\"This new and injudicious violation of the constitution was probably dictated either by the ignorance\\u003cbr\\u003eof his Syrian courtiers, or the fierce disdain of his military followers.\"],[\"As the attention of the new emperor was diverted by the most trifling amusements, he wasted many\\u003cbr\\u003emonths in his

of passion, Elagabalus resolved to execute by force what he had been unable to\\u003cbr\\u003ecompass by fraud, and by a despotic sentence degraded his cousin from the rank and honors of

emperor.\"],[\"It was impossible that such a reconciliation should last, or that even the mean soul of Elagabalus\\u003cbr\\u003ecould hold an empire on such humiliating terms of dependence.\"],[\"He soon attempted, by a dangerous experiment, to try the temper of the soldiers.\"],[\"The report of the death of Alexander, and the natural suspicion that he had been murdered,

In future lessons, we'll see other ways to use document-level embeddings and train our own embedding model for languages other than English. If you are interested in exploring more, I would check out the documentation of the package we used to load the embedding model: [sBERT](https://www.sbert.net/). They have a lot of good articles on semantic search and other applications."
